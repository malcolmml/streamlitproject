    ### Project Scope:
    This project is a conversational assistant prototype that focuses on providing users with insights and information about Singapore's Build-To-Order (BTO) housing schemes, particularly the October 2024 launch.

    ### Objectives:
    - Provide up-to-date information on BTO housing
    - Offer assistance regarding financing options, application processes, and other BTO-related queries
    - Enable interactive conversations with users to guide them through the BTO process

    ### Data Sources:
    The primary data source is publicly available information from credible sources such as:
    - Stacked Homes Editorial on BTO Launches
    - Official government websites

    ### Features:
    - Intelligent chatbot interface
    - Automated suggestion generation for follow-up questions
    - Classification of user queries as BTO-related or not

    ### Data Flow and Implementation:
    The application leverages multiple technologies and data sources to process user queries. The key components include:
    
    - **Chat Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
    - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Powered by an LLM via LangChain OpenAI for query understanding and generation of responses.
    - **Content Scraping**: Retrieves up-to-date content from trusted websites to answer BTO-related questions.

    ### Flowchart:
    The following is an illustration of the workflow for the two primary use cases of the application: 
    1. User asks a general query
    2. User asks for BTO-related information
